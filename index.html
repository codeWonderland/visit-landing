<p><strong>IMAGINE:</strong><br>
    ... <strong>one of the most stunning and expansive views</strong> of natural scenic beauty from any campus in the U.S.<br>
    ... <strong>dorm rooms that are too cool and unique to be called “dorms.”</strong> Our first-year residence halls are all Victorian-era mansions, with no two rooms the same—all equipped with ultra fast Wi-Fi—and all just steps to downtown Burlington and Lake Champlain’s waterfront.<br>
    ... <strong>a small community that nurtures big, game-changing ideas</strong> and prizes authenticity and individuality.<br>
    ... <strong>a student lifestyle that’s humming with energy</strong>: with more than 60 clubs to join, like Ski & Ride, Robotics and Equestrian, you may never have enough time to do it all, but you’ll have a blast trying!<br>
    ... <strong>a city that lives up to its hype as the “#1 best college town”</strong> ... that’s as recognized for its amazing technology culture (named “White House Techhire City”; “Top City for Tech Innovation”, etc.) as it is for its commitment to local farmers markets and sustainable practices (it was the first city in America to run completely on renewable energy).</p>

Talk to students and faculty. Ask any questions you have about admissions and financial aid. And of course, take some time to explore our beautiful campus.</p>

<h2 class="blue-head">BURLINGTON & VERMONT ARE THE BEST</h2>
<p>Burlington is home to a number of great college options (there are more than 14,000 undergraduate students residing in this lakeside city during the school year!) and has been called the best college town in America. Vermont is a nature lover’s paradise with more than 900 miles of trails to ski, ride, bike, hike and explore.</p>
