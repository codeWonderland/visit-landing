<h2 class="blue-head">INFO SESSION & CAMPUS TOUR</h2>
<p>Join us at our Perry Hall Welcome Center to learn more about our unique academic approach, life as a Champlain student, and our admission & financial aid process. After the information session you’ll go on a small-group walking tour of campus led by one of our Student Ambassadors which will give you a wonderful chance to see what being a student at Champlain is like.</p>

<h2 class="blue-head">SUMMER OPEN HOUSE: FRIDAY, JULY 13, 2018</h2>
<p>Summer Open House is one of the best (and the most fun) ways to see if who we are, and how we do things differently, is a good fit for who you are and who you want to become. Take a tour. Talk to students and faculty. Ask any questions you have about admissions and financial aid. And of course, take some time to explore our beautiful campus.</p>

<h2 class="blue-head">BURLINGTON & VERMONT ARE THE BEST</h2>
<p>Burlington is home to a number of great college options (there are more than 14,000 undergraduate students residing in this lakeside city during the school year!) and has been called the best college town in America. Vermont is a nature lover’s paradise with more than 900 miles of trails to ski, ride, bike, hike and explore.</p>
